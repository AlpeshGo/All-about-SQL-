Accessing Multiple Tables with Implicit Joins:
Problem:
1.
Perform an implicit cartesian/cross join between EMPLOYEES and JOBS tables.
```
select * from employees, jobs;
```

Problem:
2.
Retrieve only the EMPLOYEES records that correspond to jobs in the JOBS table.
```
select * from employees, jobs where employees.JOB_ID = jobs.JOB_IDENT;
```

Problem:
3.
Redo the previous query, using shorter aliases for table names.
```
select * from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;
```

Problem:
4.
Redo the previous query, but retrieve only the Employee ID, Employee Name and Job Title.
```
select EMP_ID,F_NAME,L_NAME, JOB_TITLE from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;
```

Problem:
5.
Redo the previous query, but specify the fully qualified column names with aliases in the SELECT clause.
```
select E.EMP_ID,E.F_NAME,E.L_NAME, J.JOB_TITLE from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;
```
